In React, a fresh constructor is created, then all mixins are mixed in recursively,\n  // then the actual spec is mixed in last.\n  //\n  // With ES6 classes, the properties are already there, so smart-mixin mixes functions (a, b) -> b()a(), which is\n  // the opposite of how React does it. If we reverse this array, we basically do the whole logic in reverse,\n  // which makes the result the same. See the test for more.\n  // See also:\n  // https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/41aa3496aa632634f650edbe10d617799922d265/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L853\n  if (reactMixin.mixins) {\n    reactMixin.mixins.reverse().forEach(mixinClass.bind(null, reactClass));\n  }\n\n  return reactClass;\n}\n\nmodule.exports = (function() {\n  var reactMixin = mixinProto;\n\n  reactMixin.onClass = function(reactClass, mixin) {\n    return mixinClass(reactClass, mixin);\n  };\n\n  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {\n    return function(reactClass) {\n      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);\n    };\n  };\n\n  return reactMixin;\n})();\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/react-mixin/index.js\n ** module id = 15\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","export const BollingerBand = {\n\tperiod: 20,\n\tsource: \"close\",\n\tmultiplier: 2,\n\tmovingAverageType: \"sma\"\n};\n\nexport const MACD = {\n\tfast: 12,\n\tslow: 26,\n\tsignal: 9,\n\tsource: \"close\",\n\tfill: {\n\t\thistogram: 'steelblue'\n\t},\n\tstroke: {\n\t\tMACDLine: 'red',\n\t\tsignalLine: 'green',\n\t\thistogram: 'steelblue'\n\t}\n};\n\nexport const FullStochasticOscillator = {\n\tperiod: 12,\n\tK: 3,\n\tD: 3,\n\tohlc: (d) => ({open: d.open, high: d.high, low: d.low, close: d.close}),\n\tstroke: {\n\t\tD: 'green',\n\t\tK: 'red',\n\t},\n\toverSold: 80,\n\toverBought: 20,\n};\n\nexport const RSI = {\n\tperiod: 14,\n\tsource: \"close\",\n\toverSold: 70,\n\toverBought: 30,\n};\n\nexport const EMA = {\n\tsource: \"close\",\n\tperiod: 10,\n};\n\nexport const SMA = {\n\tsource: \"close\",\n\tperiod: 10,\n};\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** /c/Ragu/Work/GC/opensource/react-stockcharts/src/lib/indicator/defaultOptions.js\n **/","\"use strict\";\n\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nclass ToolTipTSpanLabel extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn <tspan className=\"react-stockcharts-tooltip-label\" fill=\"steelblue\" {...this.props}>{this.props.children}</tspan>;\n\t}\n}\n\nmodule.exports = ToolTipTSpanLabel;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** /c/Ragu/Work/GC/opensource/react-stockcharts/src/lib/tooltip/ToolTipTSpanLabel.jsx\n **/","\"use strict\";\n\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nclass ToolTipText extends React.Component {\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn <text \n\t\t\tfontFamily={this.props.fontFamily}\n\t\t\tfontSize={this.props.fontSize}\n\t\t\t{...this.props} \n\t\t\tclassName=\"react-stockcharts-tooltip\">{this.props.children}</text>;\n\t}\n}\n\nToolTipText.propTypes = {\n\tfontFamily: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n\tfontSize: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n};\nToolTipText.defaultProps = {\n\tfontFamily: \"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\",\n\tfontSize: 11,\n};\n\nmodule.exports = ToolTipText;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** /c/Ragu/Work/GC/opensource/react-stockcharts/src/lib/tooltip/ToolTipText.jsx\n **/","var $Object = Object;\nmodule.exports = {\n  create:     $Object.create,\n  getProto:   $Object.getPrototypeOf,\n  isEnum:     {}.propertyIsEnumerable,\n  getDesc:    $Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor,\n  setDesc:    $Object.defineProperty,\n  setDescs:   $Object.defineProperties,\n  getKeys:    $Object.keys,\n  getNames:   $Object.getOwnPropertyNames,\n  getSymbols: $Object.getOwnPropertySymbols,\n  each:       [].forEach\n};\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/core-js/library/modules/$.js\n ** module id = 19\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nexports.__esModule = true;\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { 'default': obj };
