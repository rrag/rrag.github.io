The following explain the rules:\n\n   (1) When the period is even, TMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,period/2),(period/2)+1)\n   (2) When the period is odd,  TMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,(period+1)/2),(period+1)/2)\n\n In other word:\n   (1) A period of 4 becomes TMA(x,4) = SMA( SMA( x, 2), 3 )\n   (2) A period of 5 becomes TMA(x,5) = SMA( SMA( x, 3), 3 )\n\n The SMA of a SMA is the algorithm generally found in books.\n*/\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/* harmony default export */ __webpack_exports__[\"a\"] = (function () {\n\tvar options = __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__defaultOptionsForComputation__[\"p\" /* TMA */];\n\n\tfunction calculator(data) {\n\t\tvar _options = options,\n\t\t    windowSize = _options.windowSize,\n\t\t    sourcePath = _options.sourcePath;\n\n\n\t\tvar n = Math.floor(windowSize / 2);\n\t\tvar weight = windowSize % 2 === 0 ? n * (n + 1) : (n + 1) * (n + 1);\n\n\t\tvar triaverage = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__utils__[\"F\" /* slidingWindow */])().windowSize(windowSize).sourcePath(sourcePath).accumulator(function (values) {\n\t\t\tvar total = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_d3_array__[\"m\" /* sum */])(values, function (v, i) {\n\t\t\t\treturn i < n ?

The following explain the rules:\n\n   (1) When the period is even, TMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,period/2),(period/2)+1)\n   (2) When the period is odd,  TMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,(period+1)/2),(period+1)/2)\n\n In other word:\n   (1) A period of 4 becomes TMA(x,4) = SMA( SMA( x, 2), 3 )\n   (2) A period of 5 becomes TMA(x,5) = SMA( SMA( x, 3), 3 )\n\n The SMA of a SMA is the algorithm generally found in books.\n*/\n\nimport { sum } from \"d3-array\";\n\nimport { slidingWindow } from \"../utils\";\nimport { TMA as defaultOptions } from \"./defaultOptionsForComputation\";\n\nexport default function() {\n\tlet options = defaultOptions;\n\n\tfunction calculator(data)    {\n\t\tconst { windowSize, sourcePath } = options;\n\n\t\tconst n = Math.floor(windowSize / 2);\n\t\tconst weight = (windowSize % 2) === 0\n\t\t\t? n * (n + 1)\n\t\t\t: (n + 1) * (n + 1);\n\n\t\tconst triaverage = slidingWindow()\n\t\t\t.windowSize(windowSize)\n\t\t\t.sourcePath(sourcePath)\n\t\t\t.accumulator(values => {\n\t\t\t\tconst total = sum(values, (v, i) => {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn i < n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t?
