The following explain the rules:\n\n   (1) When the period is even, TMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,period/2),(period/2)+1)\n   (2) When the period is odd,  TMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,(period+1)/2),(period+1)/2)\n\n In other word:\n   (1) A period of 4 becomes TMA(x,4) = SMA( SMA( x, 2), 3 )\n   (2) A period of 5 becomes TMA(x,5) = SMA( SMA( x, 3), 3 )\n\n The SMA of a SMA is the algorithm generally found in books.\n*/\n\nimport { sum } from \"d3-array\";\n\nimport { slidingWindow } from \"../utils\";\nimport { TMA as defaultOptions } from \"./defaultOptionsForComputation\";\n\nexport default function() {\n\tlet options = defaultOptions;\n\n\tfunction calculator(data)    {\n\t\tconst { windowSize, sourcePath } = options;\n\n\t\tconst n = Math.floor(windowSize / 2);\n\t\tconst weight = (windowSize % 2) === 0\n\t\t\t? n * (n + 1)\n\t\t\t: (n + 1) * (n + 1);\n\n\t\tconst triaverage = slidingWindow()\n\t\t\t.windowSize(windowSize)\n\t\t\t.sourcePath(sourcePath)\n\t\t\t.accumulator(values => {\n\t\t\t\tconst total = sum(values, (v, i) => {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn i < n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t?

This will keep the <code>OverlaySeries</code> extensible for custom overlays too. This is a significant change as it combines indicators and overlays to be interchangable. Multiple <code>DataSeries</code> in the same <code>Chart</code> contribute to the same <code>scales</code></li>\\n<li><code>DataSeries</code> no longer accepts <code>xAccessor</code> instead, it is moved to <code>Chart</code>. Use of <code>xAccessor</code> on the <code>Chart</code> is for very simple usecases, since it does not benefit from the stock scale</li>\\n<li>Simple moving average and Exponential moving average are converted as indicators</li>\\n<li>Axes are now accesible via <code>ReStock.axes.XAxis</code>, <code>ReStock.axes.YAxis</code> against <code>ReStock.XAxis</code>, <code>ReStock.YAxis</code> in 0.1.x</li>\\n<li>No more <code>react-stockchart.css</code>. The stylesheet is no longer used. All the styling has been moved to the individual components. If you prefer to have different style attributes you can use the style related  properties of the individual components or create a custom stylesheet with the class defined in each component</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h4>Other changes</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Pure React based <code>svg</code> axes. Both <code>XAxis</code> and <code>YAxis</code> do not use <code>d3</code> to render inside <code>componentDidMount</code> / <code>componentDidUpdate</code></li>\\n<li>Added new indicators/overlays Bollinger band, RSI, MACD</li>\\n<li>A new property <code>type</code> is added to <code>ChartCanvas</code> and it takes one of 2 values\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>svg</code> which creates the chart using pure svg</li>\\n<li><code>hybrid</code> which creates the chart using a combination of <code>svg</code> and <code>canvas</code>. <code>canvas</code> is used to draw the different series, like Line, Area, Candlestick, Histogram etc. and <code>svg</code> is used for the <code>XXXTooltip</code>, <code>MousePointer</code>, <code>XAxis</code> <code>YAxis</code> and the <code>EdgeIndicator</code></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>add <code>jsnext:main</code> to <code>package.json</code> for use with <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rollup/rollup\\\">rollup</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<hr>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/md/CHANGE-LOG.md\n// module id = 546\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports = \"<p>Open the dev tools console and see the output of click</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts/blob/master/docs/lib/charts/CandleStickChartWithClickHandlerCallback.jsx\\\">source</a>, <a href=\\\"http://bl.ocks.org/rrag/67894a887e52891aa2a3\\\">block</a>, <a href=\\\"http://plnkr.co/edit/gist:67894a887e52891aa2a3?p=preview\\\">plunker</a> of this example</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/md/CLICK-CALLBACK-INTERACTIVE-INDICATOR.md\n// module id = 547\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports = \"<h2>v0.7</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/envelope.asp?optm=sa_v2\\\">Envelope</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.incrediblecharts.com/indicators/atr_average_true_range_trailing_stops.php\\\">ATR Trailing stop</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:chandelier_exit\\\">Chandelier Exit</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:parabolic_sar\\\">Parabolic SAR</a>\\n<ul>\\n<li>With mouse hover highlight</li>\\n<li>right click context menu</li>\\n<li>double click listener</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Explore refactoring of interactive indicators to use canvas (again)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h4>New Interactive components</h4>\\n<p>Do not store any state in the interactive components other than hover &amp;

They are discussed at great length <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12310024/fast-and-responsive-interactive-charts-graphs-svg-canvas-other\\\">here</a> and <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5882716/html5-canvas-vs-svg-vs-div\\\">here</a>. Needless to say they are both very powerful and for charting, there really is no right answer.</p>\\n<p>Using <code>svg</code> is very convenient from a developer standpoint. Easy to debug, even easier to style. Using css to style a chart is just too cool to pass. However there comes a point where performance &amp; memory become a bottleneck, especially in tablets/mobile (well in desktops too). Pan actions lag behind and not so responsive. and when looking at a lot of data points like the chart below, there are approx 300 DOM elements. and on pan action all these are updated to different <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>height</code> &amp; <code>width</code>. The time taken to calculate the new values on pan is negligible (&lt;10 ms) but when rendering them, you can see for yourself.</p>\\n<p>Here is where <code>canvas</code> shines. Given this dilemma react-stockcharts provides 2 options.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>svg only</li>\\n<li>svg and canvas</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Except the tooltip everything else, including the crosshair, axes, the chart series are all drawn on canvas. The tooltip I am retaining it in <code>svg</code> because of the ability to attach mouse hover and click event to the <code>svg</code> DOM. If there are better suggestions to use <code>canvas</code> for tooltip and also support click events and mouse hover state please share them.</p>\\n<p>The SVG approach is best for server side rendering, while for browser side I recommend using the hybrid mode for improved responsiveness to pan actions.</p>\\n<h4>DOM Manipulation</h4>\\n<p>All SVG components use ReactJS, to create the svg elements, there is no DOM manipulation. For dealing with Canvas, since canvas is a DOM object, it has to be done via a <code>componentDidMount</code> / <code>componentDidUpdate</code></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Below you can see the improvements in responsiveness to pan actions when using the svg + canvas option</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/md/SVG-VS-CANVAS.md\n// module id = 584\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports = \"<ul>\\n<li>create a line - click, mousemove, click\\n<ul>\\n<li>by default the line edge snaps to the nearest high or low, press Shift when you click to disable snap temporarily</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Once a line is drawn it gets out of draw mode automatically.
