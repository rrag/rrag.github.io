The following explain the rules:\n\n   (1) When the period is even, TRIMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,period/2),(period/2)+1)\n   (2) When the period is odd,  TRIMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,(period+1)/2),(period+1)/2)\n\n In other word:\n   (1) A period of 4 becomes TRIMA(x,4) = SMA( SMA( x, 2), 3 )\n   (2) A period of 5 becomes TRIMA(x,5) = SMA( SMA( x, 3), 3 )\n\n The SMA of a SMA is the algorithm generally found in books.\n*/\n\nimport { sum } from \"d3-array\";\n\nimport { slidingWindow } from \"../../utils\";\nimport { TRIMA as defaultOptions } from \"../defaultOptionsForComputation\";\n\nexport default function() {\n\n\tvar { windowSize, sourcePath } = defaultOptions;\n\n\tfunction calculator(data)    {\n\n\t\tvar n = Math.floor(windowSize / 2);\n\t\tvar weight = (windowSize % 2) === 0\n\t\t\t? n * (n + 1)\n\t\t\t: (n + 1) * (n + 1);\n\n\t\tvar triaverage = slidingWindow()\n\t\t\t.windowSize(windowSize)\n\t\t\t.sourcePath(sourcePath)\n\t\t\t.accumulator(values => {\n\t\t\t\tvar total = sum(values, (v, i) => {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn i < n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t?
