The following explain the rules:\n\n   (1) When the period is even, TRIMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,period/2),(period/2)+1)\n   (2) When the period is odd,  TRIMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,(period+1)/2),(period+1)/2)\n\n In other word:\n   (1) A period of 4 becomes TRIMA(x,4) = SMA( SMA( x, 2), 3 )\n   (2) A period of 5 becomes TRIMA(x,5) = SMA( SMA( x, 3), 3 )\n\n The SMA of a SMA is the algorithm generally found in books.\n*/\n\nimport { sum } from \"d3-array\";\n\nimport { slidingWindow } from \"../../utils\";\nimport { TRIMA as defaultOptions } from \"../defaultOptionsForComputation\";\n\nexport default function() {\n\n\tvar { windowSize, sourcePath } = defaultOptions;\n\n\tfunction calculator(data)    {\n\n\t\tvar n = Math.floor(windowSize / 2);\n\t\tvar weight = (windowSize % 2) === 0\n\t\t\t? n * (n + 1)\n\t\t\t: (n + 1) * (n + 1);\n\n\t\tvar triaverage = slidingWindow()\n\t\t\t.windowSize(windowSize)\n\t\t\t.sourcePath(sourcePath)\n\t\t\t.accumulator(values => {\n\t\t\t\tvar total = sum(values, (v, i) => {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn i < n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t?

Look closer, you will find that the candles are not spread at regular intervals, there is a gap of say 2 candles every so often. That gap is because the data is plot on a continuous time scale, and a continuous time scale has week ends and national holidays, days when trading does not happen.

data points, the decision of performance is bound to come up, and HTML5 presents options.</p>\\n<p>I am not going to debate between the pros and cons between SVG and Canvas. They are discussed at great length <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12310024/fast-and-responsive-interactive-charts-graphs-svg-canvas-other\\\">here</a> and <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5882716/html5-canvas-vs-svg-vs-div\\\">here</a>. Needless to say they are both very powerful and for charting, there really is no right answer.</p>\\n<p>Using <code>svg</code> is very convenient from a developer standpoint. Easy to debug, even easier to style. Using css to style a chart is just too cool to pass. However there comes a point where performance &amp; memory become a bottleneck, especially in tablets/mobile (well in desktops too). Pan actions lag behind and not so responsive. and when looking at a lot of data points like the chart below, there are approx 300 DOM elements. and on pan action all these are updated to different <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>height</code> &amp; <code>width</code>. The time taken to calculate the new values on pan is negligible (&lt;10 ms) but when rendering them, you can see for yourself.</p>\\n<p>Here is where <code>canvas</code> shines. Given this dilemma react-stockcharts provides 2 options.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>svg only</li>\\n<li>svg and canvas</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Except the tooltip everything else, including the crosshair, axes, the chart series are all drawn on canvas. The tooltip I am retaining it in <code>svg</code> because of the ability to attach mouse hover and click event to the <code>svg</code> DOM. If there are better suggestions to use <code>canvas</code> for tooltip and also support click events and mouse hover state please share them.</p>\\n<p>The SVG approach is best for server side rendering, while for browser side I recommend using the hybrid mode for improved responsiveness to pan actions.</p>\\n<h4>DOM Manipulation</h4>\\n<p>All SVG components use ReactJS, to create the svg elements, there is no DOM manipulation. For dealing with Canvas, since canvas is a DOM object, it has to be done via a <code>componentDidMount</code> / <code>componentDidUpdate</code></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Below you can see the improvements in responsiveness to pan actions when using the svg + canvas option</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/md/SVG-VS-CANVAS.md\n// module id = 561\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports = \"<ul>\\n<li>create a line - click, mousemove, click\\n<ul>\\n<li>by default the line edge snaps to the nearest high or low, press Shift when you click to disable snap temporarily</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Once a line is drawn it gets out of draw mode automatically.
